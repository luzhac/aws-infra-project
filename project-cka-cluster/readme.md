This project demonstrates two different methods to **create and manage a Kubernetes cluster on AWS**, designed as part of a **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** learning and DevOps practice environment.

## 🌐 Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **fully functional Kubernetes environment** on AWS, using both:
1. **Manual EC2-based control plane setup** – to understand cluster internals and key components.
2. **Automated provisioning via AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** – to simulate production-grade environments using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
